# Backend Quality Guidelines

> Review and test standards for Game Service work.

## Project-Specific Quality Bar

The backend is the authoritative MMORPG rules engine. Correctness matters more than making the Minecraft presentation "feel like it worked" locally.

Hard requirements:

* Adapter never decides trusted combat, loot, cultivation, reincarnation, or account progression outcomes.
* Game modules interact through service interfaces.
* Any deterministic gameplay formula gets direct tests.
* Any data file or generated content format gets schema validation.
* Any player lifecycle slice gets at least one integration or end-to-end test.

## Forbidden Patterns

* Business logic in FastAPI route handlers.
* Business logic in the Paper Adapter.
* Cross-module table access from repositories.
* Trusting damage, loot, breakthrough success, reincarnation status, or item eligibility values sent by the client/plugin.
* Silent fallback to default gameplay values when authoritative data is missing.
* Broad `except Exception` that returns success or hides failure.
* Adding a mature Minecraft plugin as a shortcut around Game Service authority.

## Required Patterns

* Thin route -> service -> repository flow.
* Pydantic schemas for API request/response boundaries.
* Explicit domain errors with stable codes.
* Transaction boundaries around multi-step state mutations.
* Tests written with readable examples, e.g. "100 attack vs 50 defense produces expected damage".
* Data-driven content where practical: items, mobs, quests, skills, and techniques should be schemas plus interpreters, not scattered `if id == ...` branches.

## Testing Requirements

Follow the architecture document's three-layer strategy:

1. Data/schema validation tests for configuration files and content.
2. Formula tests for deterministic combat, cultivation, item, and loot rules.
3. End-to-end tests for vertical player loops.

First vertical-slice tests should prove:

* account/life state can be created and reloaded
* spirit root detection persists to the current life
* a simple cultivation/progression action changes authoritative Game Service state
* API responses match schemas expected by the Adapter

## Review Checklist

Before marking backend work complete, verify:

* Does the change preserve Game Service authority?
* Did any module reach into another module's repository/table?
* Are all new API payloads typed with Pydantic schemas?
* Are domain failures mapped to stable error codes?
* Are database writes transactional where a partial write would corrupt game state?
* Are logs useful for tracing a player state transition without leaking secrets?
* Are tests present at the right level for the risk?
* Were docs/specs updated if a new convention was established?

## Initial Verification Commands

No backend project exists yet. The first scaffold task must add concrete commands here, such as:

```bash
cd game-service
ruff check .
pyright .
pytest
```

Until those tools exist, verification for spec-only changes is documentation review plus consistency checks.
